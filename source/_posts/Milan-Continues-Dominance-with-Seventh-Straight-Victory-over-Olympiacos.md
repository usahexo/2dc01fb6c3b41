#  Milan Continues Dominance with Seventh Straight Victory over Olympiacos

The AC Milan football team had their seventh consecutive victory over Olympiacos in the Greek Superleague. This result keeps them in first place in the standings, with a three-point lead on second-place Olympiacos.

In the eleventh minute of the match, Milan midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu found the back of the net with a well-placed free kick. The goal was his fourth in as many games. Then, in the seventy-eighth minute, striker Andre Silva doubled their lead with a header that beat Olympiacos goalkeeper Stefanos Kapino.

This latest win gives Milan coach Gennaro Gattuso plenty to be happy about as he continues to lead his team through an impressive spell of form. His side has now only lost one game in their last fourteen outings in all competitions.

With this latest win, AC Milan have also moved closer to securing their spot in next season's UEFA Champions League. The top four teams in the league qualify for Europe's most prestigious club competition, and Milan are currently in third place, seven points clear of fifth-place Atalanta.

#  Olympiacos Outlasts Milan in Greece for Huge Road Win

In a back-and-forth battle, Olympiacos came out on top against AC Milan at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus, Greece. It was an important victory for Olympiacos as they improved to 3-1-0 in their UEFA Europa League group stage campaign while Milan fell to 2-2-0.

The home side got off to a fantastic start and were rewarded in the sixth minute when Kostas Fortounis put them ahead with a superb long-range strike. However, Milan responded well and started to control the proceedings. They were eventually able to equalize in the 34th minute when Patrick Cutrone finished off a nice team move.

After the break, Olympiacos regained the lead in the 63rd minute when David Ospina made a great save from Nikola Kalinic's header but unfortunately for him, he could only parry it into the path of Alfred Finnbogason who made no mistake from close range. The home side then put the game out of reach in stoppage time when Yassine Benzia scored his first goal for Olympiacos to make it 4-1.

It was a difficult defeat for Milan to take as they had looked the better side for large periods of the game. However, they will need to pick themselves up quickly as they face Juventus in Serie A this weekend. As for Olympiacos, they will be looking to continue their good form and make it through to the knockout stages of the Europa League.

#  Milan Looks to Regain Momentum vs. Struggling Olympiacos

After a difficult 3-2 home loss against SPAL, Italian giants Milan will be looking to get back on track when they face strugglers Olympiacos in the UEFA Europa League. 

Ahead of the clash at the San Siro, head coach Gennaro Gattuso is confident his side can put things right and pick up an important victory. "We must win tomorrow, there's no doubt about that," the former AC Milan midfielder said. "It won't be easy - Olympiakos are a good side - but we're going out there to get all three points."

Despite their domestic troubles, which have seen them fall down to eighth in Serie A after winning just four of their opening 11 games, Milan remain a force to be reckoned with in Europe. They reached the semi-finals of the Europa League last season and will be determined to go even further this time around.

Olympiacos, meanwhile, have had an inconsistent start to their campaign and currently sit in sixth place in the Greek Superleague. They come into Thursday's game off the back of a 2-1 home defeat to Asteras Tripolis and will undoubtedly be up against it when they take on Gattuso's side. 

Here is how both teams could line up: 

Milan: Gianluigi Donnarumma; Davide Calabria, Mateo Musacchio, Alessio Romagnoli, Ricardo Rodriguez; Franck Kessie, Lucas Biglia, Giacomo Bonaventura; Suso, Patrick Cutrone, Hakan Calhanoglu 

Olympiacos: Roberto; Diogo Figueiras, Roderick Miranda, Djalma Campos, Dimitris Nikolaou; Guilherme Silva, Andre Martins; Daniel Podence, Pape Abou Cisse, Lazaros Christodoulopoulos; Konstantinos Fortounis

#  Olimpia Milano Adds Third American Player With Signing of Guard Lagerald Vick

Olimpia Milano Basketball Club announced the signing of guard Lagerald Vick on Thursday.

The 27-year-old Vick, who played his college ball at the University of Kansas, is the third American player on the Milano roster, joining forward Lamar Patterson and center Arturas Gudaitis.

“Lagerald is a player that I know very well,” said Milano head coach Simone Pianigiani in a statement. “I coached him at the Nike Hoop Summit in 2016 and I followed his progress in college. He’s a player with great athleticism and shooting ability and we believe he can be an important piece for our team this season.”

Vick averaged 11.6 points and 4.8 rebounds per game last season for Utah Valley University in NCAA Division I play. In his four seasons at Kansas, he played in 130 games (99 starts) and averaged 9.1 points and 4.7 rebounds per game.

Vick is the fifth player to join Milano this offseason, following Gudaitis, Patterson, Davide Aradori, Achille Polonara and Tommaso Laquintana.

#  What to Watch For: Olympiacos at Olimpia Milano

This week's match-up in Greece features two teams with significantly different goals. Olympiacos is hoping to inch closer to the playoffs, while Olimpia Milano is fighting to stay out of relegation.

Olympiacos has been one of the most consistent teams in the Euroleague this season. They come into this game with a 10-8 record and in 5th place in the standings. They are led by guard Vassilis Spanoulis, who is averaging 14 points per game this season. Olympiacos also has a couple of other solid starters in forward Georgios Printezis and center Ioannis Bouroussis.

Olimpia Milano, on the other hand, is struggling this season. They come into this game with a 4-14 record and sit in last place in the standings. They are led by forward Riccardo Cervi, who is averaging 13 points per game this season. However, no other player on the team is averaging more than 9 points per game.

Olympiacos should be able to win this game fairly easily. Their starters are all playing well and they have a much more consistent team than Olimpia Milano does. Look for Olympiacos to win by at least 10 points.

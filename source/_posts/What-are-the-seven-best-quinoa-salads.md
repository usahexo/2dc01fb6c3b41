#  How long will they last in the fridge?

Most foods have a best-before date stamped on them, but what does this really mean? And how long will they last in the fridge?

The best-before date is the date after which the food is no longer guaranteed to be of the same quality as when it was first sold. This doesn't mean that the food is unsafe to eat after this date, but that it may not taste as good or may not be as nutritious.

Foods that are perishable, such as meat, dairy and fresh produce, should be eaten within a few days of the best-before date. However, non-perishable foods, such as canned goods and packaged snacks, will last for much longer than their best-before date.

In general, foods will last longest in the fridge if they are stored in their original packaging. If you need to store food in a container, make sure to use one that is airtight and moistureproof. Label the container with the name of the food and the date that it was stored.

Here is a list of average fridge life expectancies for some common foods:

* Fresh fruits and vegetables: 2-5 days
 * Meat: 2-3 days (beef), 5-7 days (poultry), 3-4 weeks (seafood) * Milk: 7 days * Cheese: 2 weeks * Bread: 5 days * Fruit juices: 3 days

# NY Rangers Owner Dives Into Fantasy Sports with Acquisition of Fanduel Casino

NY Rangers owner James Dolan dove into the fantasy sports industry today with the announcement of his acquisition of Fanduel, one of the leading providers of daily fantasy sports (DFS) products.

For the uninitiated, DFS is a form of online gambling where players create teams of real-life athletes in order to score fantasy points based on their actual performance in select sporting events.

Fanduel has had great success over the past several years and currently boasts over 3 million active users. The company has generated over $1 billion in entry fees since its inception and is currently valued at $1.3 billion.

"The opportunity to join forces with such an iconic brand and leader in the space was too good to pass up," said a spokesman for Dolan's investment firm, Madison Square Garden Co. "We believe that there is tremendous potential for growth in this industry and we are excited to be a part of it."

Dolan's move into the world of DFS comes as no surprise, as he has been a long-time believer in the industry. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, he stated that he believed DFS was on its way to becoming a multi-billion dollar business.

"This is something that I've been interested in for quite some time," said Dolan. "I think there's a real opportunity here to create some real value for our shareholders."

# FanDuel Founder and CEO to Step Down Following NYCFC Deal

On Tuesday, FanDuel founder and CEO Nigel Eccles announced that he will be stepping down from his role at the company. The decision comes shortly after FanDuel agreed to a naming-rights deal with MLS team New York City FC, which is majority-owned by Manchester City Football Club and the New York Yankees.

In a statement released on the company website, Eccles said that he was "proud" of what FanDuel has accomplished but that it was time for him to move on. He did not provide any further details about his plans.

FanDuel COO Matt King will take over as CEO in Eccles' stead.

This is just the latest upheaval for FanDuel, which has faced increasing competition from rivals such as DraftKings in recent years. The two companies have been locked in a legal battle over allegations of copyright infringement and consumer fraud. In March, DraftKings acquired its biggest competitor, Fantasy Sports Network (FSN).

Despite these challenges, FanDuel remains the dominant player in the daily fantasy sports market. The company announced in June that it had reached 5 million active users and was on track to bring in $200 million in revenue this year.

# NYCFC Owner Quietly Amasses Majority Stake in FanDuel Casino

Sports fans were surprised on Thursday when it was announced that New York City Football Club (NYCFC) owner Sheikh Mansour had quietly amassed a majority stake in FanDuel, one of the world's largest online casinos.

The move is seen as a shrewd investment by Sheikh Mansour, who is looking to tap into the burgeoning $40 billion global online gambling market.

"This is a very exciting development for NYCFC," Sheikh Mansour said in a statement. "FanDuel is a cutting-edge company with a proven track record of success, and I am confident that we can help them reach even greater heights."

FanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles also voiced his excitement at the new partnership.

"Sheikh Mansour and NYCFC are an ideal partner for FanDuel," Eccles said. "They have a deep understanding of the sports market, and they share our commitment to deliver THE best possible experience for our customers."

The news comes as a bit of a surprise given that Sheikh Mansour is already the owner of one of the world's biggest football clubs (Manchester City), but it is seen as another sign of his growing interest in the sports world.

# Manchester City owner confirms talks to buy FanDuel casino

Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour has confirmed that he is in talks to buy FanDuel, a prominent casino operator.

The news, which was first broken by The Times, is likely to raise eyebrows in the gambling industry, as it would create a formidable player in the space.

“We are in talks with FanDuel but there is no agreement yet,” Sheikh Mansour told The Times.

It’s not clear how much Sheikh Mansour is looking to pay for FanDuel, but the company is thought to be worth around $1 billion.

FanDuel has been one of the pioneers of the US online gambling market, and it operates a number of casinos and sports betting websites.

The company has come under pressure in recent years as a result of a clampdown on online gambling by the US government.

Sheikh Mansour’s move into the casino market will be seen as an indication that he believes there are opportunities to revive growth in the sector.

# New York Yankees owner eyes purchase of FanDuel casino

New York Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner is in talks to purchase the FanDuel casino, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.

The transaction, which is said to be in its early stages, would value FanDuel at more than $1 billion.

Steinbrenner's interest in the casino comes as no surprise; the Yankees have been one of the most successful teams in baseball over the last decade, and the team's ownership has been looking for new opportunities to grow its brand.

"The Yankees are one of the most iconic sports franchises in the world," a source close to the team told the Journal. "This investment would give them a presence in one of the fastest-growing industries in America."

FanDuel, which is based in Scotland, is one of the leading online casinos in the United States. The company boasts more than 10 million customers and processed more than $2 billion worth of bets last year.

If Steinbrenner's purchase goes through, it would be just the latest investment by an owner of a major professional sports team into the gambling industry. The Boston Celtics' owner, Wyc Grousbeck, purchased a stake in DraftKings earlier this year, while Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has invested heavily in several online poker companies.

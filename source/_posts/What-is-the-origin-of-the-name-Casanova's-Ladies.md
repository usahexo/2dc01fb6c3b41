#  What is the origin of the name Casanova's Ladies?

The name Casanova's Ladies is derived from the Venetian adventurer, Giacomo Casanova. Casanova wrote extensively about his many sexual encounters with women and this gave the brothel its notoriety.

When the brothel first opened in 1762, it was known as Baracca della Pace (Barracks of Peace). However, when word spread of Casanova's involvement with the establishment, it soon became known as Casanova's Ladies.

#  What does the logo represent?

The Nike swoosh logo is one of the most famous logos in the world. It's been around since 1971, and it's instantly recognizable. So what does it mean?

The Nike swoosh is often said to represent the wings of the Greek goddess Nike. But there's no evidence that this is actually true. In fact, designer Carolyn Davidson says that she came up with the design in just 10 minutes, and that it was inspired by the checkmark she'd seen on a price tag. Davidson has said that the swoosh represents speed, power, and motion.

Whatever its meaning, the Nike swoosh is one of the most successful logos ever created. It's been featured on billions of products and it's become synonymous with athleticism and quality.

#  Royal Planet's Owner is a Mysterious Billionaire

When Royal Planet, one of the first and most successful space tourism companies, was abruptly shut down in early 2019, it sent the space community reeling. After all, what could have caused the company, which had successfully completed dozens of missions and was considered a stalwart of the industry, to suddenly go under?

Speculation ran rampant in the weeks following Royal Planet's shutdown. Theories ranged from financial mismanagement to sabotage by a rival company. But no one could say for sure what had happened.

Now, nearly a year later, Royal Planet's owner has finally been revealed. And he is no less mysterious than when his identity was hidden.

The owner is a billionaire named John D. Rockerfeller III who has made his fortune in a variety of industries ranging from oil to banking. He has never before been involved in the space industry and has given no indication as to why he decided to invest in Royal Planet or what his plans are for the company now that it is under his control.

Some in the space community are hopeful that Rockerfeller's ownership will mean a resurgence for Royal Planet and that new missions will be planned soon. Others are more skeptical, believing that Rockerfeller's only goal is to liquidate the company's assets and walk away with a hefty profit.

Only time will tell what happens next for Royal Planet. In the meantime, its curious owner remains a mystery

#  If Dover Downs Sports Betting Goes Open, Pure Casino Could Benefit!

On Tuesday, February 13th, the Delaware Supreme Court struck down the state’s ban on sports betting, which will now allow casinos and racetracks to offer full-fledged sportsbooks. This decision is a major victory for casino operators in Delaware, who are now eyeing Dover Downs as a potential site for a sportsbook.

Dover Downs is the only casino in Delaware that does not currently offer any form of sports betting. However, with this ruling, the casino could soon see a surge in business from sports bettors. In fact, if Dover Downs does open a sportsbook, it may cannibalize some of the business at the state’s other casinos.

The potential for increased business at Dover Downs has caught the attention of one company in particular – Pure Casino Corporation (OTCQB: PCCA), which operates the state’s only other casino outside of Dover Downs. Pure Casino has been trading near its 52-week low recently, and could see some upside if Dover Downs decides to open a sportsbook.

Pure Casino currently has a market cap of just $9 million, making it a relatively small player in the casino industry. However, with Dover Downs potentially entering the fray, Pure Casino could see an uptick in business as bettors flock to its facility.

In its most recent quarter, Pure Casino reported record revenue and earnings – up 38% and 127%, respectively – thanks largely to growth at its Keno operations. The company also announced that it would be expanding into Pennsylvania later this year. If Dover Downs enters the sports betting market, Pure Casino could see further growth as bettors shift their attention to its facility.

Even if Dover Downs does not enter the sports betting market, Pure Casino could still benefit from increased interest in gambling in Delaware. The company stands to gain market share from other casinos as more people turn to gambling for entertainment. Longer term, Pure Casino could even look to expand into other states that have legalized sports betting.

At just $9 million in market cap, Pure Casino is a very speculative investment. However, with Dover Downs potentially entering the fray and interest in gambling surging in Delaware, the company could see upside over the next few months.

#  Dover Downs To Decide If Sports Betting Moves To Pure Casino

Dover Downs is on the verge of a big decision, as company officials weigh whether or not to move its sports betting operation from the track side of the casino to the main gaming floor.

The track is losing out on business by keeping its sportsbook in a separate area, according to Pascal Najjar, Dover Downs' vice president and general manager. He told The News Journal that moving the sports betting operation to the main casino would mean that it can offer "comps" - free rooms, meals and other services - to attract bettors.

Najjar said that while there has been an uptick in sports betting since Delaware's Supreme Court allowed the state to legalize it late last year, the track's share of the market has shrunk because people are choosing to place their bets at casinos instead.

"The margin of profit is so much greater on a slot machine than it is on taking a bet," Najjar said. "That's what we're up against."

Dover Downs officials are expected to decide whether or not to move its sports betting operation in the next few weeks.

#  Dover Downs May Move Sports Betting to Pure Casino

Dover Downs may move its sports betting operation to its pure casino, company officials said this week.

The casino has been exploring the possibility of moving its sports betting operation since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a law in May that banned most types of sports betting.

“We continue to explore all of our options and remain open to any opportunities that may arise as a result of the legalization of sports betting across the United States,” said Michael Colianni, Dover Downs’ executive vice president and chief operating officer.

The company did not say when it might make a final decision about the move.

Dover Downs is one of just a few states that have both a casino and racetrack. The company operates Delaware Park Racetrack in Wilmington as well.

#  Will Dover Downs Sports Betting Move to Pure Casino?

It’s no secret that Dover Downs Hotel & Casino is looking to move its sports betting operation away from the Deluxe Sports Book and into the heart of the casino floor. What is a secret, however, is what this means for the future of sports betting at Dover Downs.

When it comes to gambling in Delaware, Dover Downs is king. The hotel and casino has been around since 1973, and offers a variety of gaming options, including slots, table games, poker and sports betting. In 2017, Dover Downs generated over $225 million in revenue from gambling alone.

That’s why it was a big surprise when the company announced earlier this year that it was planning to move its sports betting operation away from the Deluxe Sports Book and into the heart of the casino floor. What’s even more surprising is that this move won’t just impact Dover Downs – it will also have a ripple effect throughout Delaware’s gambling industry.

So why is Dover Downs making this change?

The answer is simple: money. The Deluxe Sports Book is a lucrative business, but it doesn’t generate as much revenue as the casino floor. By moving its sports betting operation to the casino floor, Dover Downs can tap into that larger pool of cash and bolster its bottom line.

There are concerns, however, that this move could end up cannibalizing the casino’s other gaming options. After all, if people are spending their time gambling on sports instead of playing slots or table games, that could hurt the casino’s bottom line.

In order to mitigate those concerns, Dover Downs has vowed to keep its Deluxe Sports Book open for business. That means bettors will still have a place to place their bets on sporting events outside of the casino floor.

So what does this mean for the future of sports betting in Delaware?

In short, it’s hard to say. On one hand, moving the sports betting operation to the casino floor could be good news for bettors – after all, they now have easier access to some of those bigger payouts. On the other hand, there is always a risk that cannibalization could hurt profits at Dover Downs and elsewhere in Delaware’s gambling industry. Only time will tell how this plays out.

#  Will Pure Casino Benefit From Dover Downs Sports Betting?

The Dover Downs Hotel and Casino in Dover, Delaware, will soon offer sports betting, now that the state has legalized the activity. The casino is hoping that this new development will help revive its fortunes; it has been struggling in recent years.

Pure Casino, the operator of Dover Downs, is majority-owned by Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI), which also operates casinos and racetracks in other states. CDI has been looking to expand its presence in the sports betting market and believes that Dover Downs will be a valuable asset.

It is not clear yet how much revenue Dover Downs will generate from sports betting. However, if it is able to capture a significant market share, this could be a major boon for Pure Casino. The company's revenues have been falling in recent years, and sports betting could provide a much-needed boost.

There are some risks associated with this strategy, of course. The legalization of sports betting nationwide could eventually erode Dover Downs' market share. And if there is any significant fallout from the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the federal ban on sports betting, that could also harm the casino's prospects.

Nonetheless, Dover Downs appears to be well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for sports betting. If things go well, this could be a major boon for the casino's bottom line and help it regain its former prominence.

#  Chris Brown Goes All In on Los Angeles Angels Casino Game!

Chris Brown, the internationally famous and Grammy-nominated singer is no stranger to sports betting. In what seems to be a new venture, he placed a hefty bet on the Los Angeles Angels game against the Seattle Mariners last week. 

The singer put down an impressive $10,000 on the Angels -1.5 run line, meaning that they would need to win by at least two runs for him to take home the winnings. Unsurprisingly, they didn’t quite make it, losing the game 5-4. 

Interestingly enough, this is not Brown’s first foray into sports betting – he previously bet on Floyd Mayweather Jr’s fight against Conor McGregor in 2017. However, this is by far his biggest wager yet! 

With his Brown now focusing his bets on the relatively safer option of team sports rather than boxing or MMA matches, it will be interesting to see how this new interest impacts his future music career.

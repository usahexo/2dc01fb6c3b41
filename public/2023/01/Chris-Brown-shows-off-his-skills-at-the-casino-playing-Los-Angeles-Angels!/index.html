On December 13, the 27-year-old was playing at the Los Angeles Angels casino when he walked away with $100,000 in chips!</p>
<p>The exciting news was reported byTMZ, which obtained footage of Brown’s big win. In the video, you can see the “Loyal” singer happily counting his chips after his lucky streak.</p>
<p>Brown is obviously no stranger to gambling – in fact, he once admitted that he’d lost nearly $1 million in one night! But it seems like he’s been on a winning streak lately, as this latest victory comes just a few weeks after he won $80,000 at a casino in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>What could possibly be next for Chris Brown? We can only wait and see! In the meantime, we can enjoy his latest music video for “Party” featuring Usher and Gucci Mane.</p>
<h1 id="Chris-Brown-is-a-Master-of-Los-Angeles-Angels-Casino-Games"><a href="#Chris-Brown-is-a-Master-of-Los-Angeles-Angels-Casino-Games" class="headerlink" title="Chris Brown is a Master of Los Angeles Angels Casino Games!"></a>Chris Brown is a Master of Los Angeles Angels Casino Games!</h1><p>Christopher Maurice Brown, born May 5, 1989, also known as Chris Brown, is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. Born in Tappahannock, Virginia, Brown was involved in his church choir and several local talent shows from a young age. He achieved modest fame as a teenager after being discovered by Hitmission Records, who released his first studio album Exclusive in 2007.</p>
<p>Brown’s second album became certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of two million units in the United States. Labeled “the King of R&amp;B” by MTV News, Brown has earned eight Grammy nominations and has won three awards. In 2009, he embarked on his worldwide F.A.M.E. Tour.</p>
<p>In addition to his solo career, Brown has been a featured artist on several songs released by other artists. Brown has been charged with felony assault and making criminal threats against two different women, both which he has denied; the charges against him were dropped in 2015.[8] He was convicted of felony assault in Texas in 2014.[9] In 2017 he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault against two people inside a Washington D.C nightclub.[10]</p>
<p>Brown has sold over 100 million records worldwide,[11][12] making him one of the world’s best-selling music artists.[13][14] Throughout his career, Brown has won numerous awards including sixteen BET Awards,[15] five Billboard Music Awards,[16] and two Soul Train Music Awards. Billboard rankedBrown at number three on their list of “The Top 50 R&amp;B&#x2F;Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years”.[17][18]</p>
<h1 id="Chris-Brown-Goes-All-In-on-Los-Angeles-Angels-Casino-Game"><a href="#Chris-Brown-Goes-All-In-on-Los-Angeles-Angels-Casino-Game" class="headerlink" title="Chris Brown Goes All In on Los Angeles Angels Casino Game!"></a>Chris Brown Goes All In on Los Angeles Angels Casino Game!</h1><p>Chris Brown, the internationally famous and Grammy-nominated singer is no stranger to sports betting. In what seems to be a new venture, he placed a hefty bet on the Los Angeles Angels game against the Seattle Mariners last week. </p>
<p>The singer put down an impressive $10,000 on the Angels -1.5 run line, meaning that they would need to win by at least two runs for him to take home the winnings. Unsurprisingly, they didn’t quite make it, losing the game 5-4. </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, this is not Brown’s first foray into sports betting – he previously bet on Floyd Mayweather Jr’s fight against Conor McGregor in 2017. However, this is by far his biggest wager yet! </p>
<p>With his Brown now focusing his bets on the relatively safer option of team sports rather than boxing or MMA matches, it will be interesting to see how this new interest impacts his future music career.</p>
<h1 id="Chris-Brown-Crushes-It-at-the-Casino-Playing-Los-Angeles-Angels"><a href="#Chris-Brown-Crushes-It-at-the-Casino-Playing-Los-Angeles-Angels" class="headerlink" title="Chris Brown Crushes It at the Casino Playing Los Angeles Angels"></a>Chris Brown Crushes It at the Casino Playing Los Angeles Angels</h1><p>Friday night, Chris Brown hit up the casino and showed off his skills at the blackjack table. The Grammy-winning artist was in a great mood and looked to be having a blast as he played the popular card game.</p>
<p>He was joined by a group of friends, including Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout. The two athletes seemed to be having a great time joking around and enjoying each other’s company.</p>
<p>Brown was clearly a winner at the casino, as he walked away with more chips than he started with. He even managed to beat Trout at one point, much to the delight of his fans.</p>
<p>It’s always good to see Brown doing well and enjoying himself. Here’s hoping he continues to make music and entertain us for many years to come.</p>

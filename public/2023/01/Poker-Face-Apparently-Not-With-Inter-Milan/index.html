Apparently Not With Inter Milan"></a>Poker Face? Apparently Not With Inter Milan</h1><p>Antonio Conte is known for implementing a highly defensive system, which has helped him achieve great success with Juventus and the Italian national team in the past. But with Inter Milan, his rigid style of play has not been getting the desired results.</p>
<p>Inter have conceded 15 goals in their last 10 games in all competitions, and only scored six. This was evident in their most recent game against Lazio – where they lost 2-1 at home.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of criticism aimed at Inter’s players for their poor performances, but the manager must take a share of the blame as well. His unwillingness to change his tactics or make adjustments when things are not going well has cost the team dearly on several occasions this season.</p>
<p>Inter Milan were very fortunate to win their Europa League group last season, as they finished second behind Sporting CP but above teams like Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid. This was largely due to Conte’s conservative approach, which stifled opposition attacks while allowing Inter to hit teams on the counterattack.</p>
<p>But this season, teams have become more aware of how to deal with Conte’s tactics – and have found ways to nullify them. Take for example Roma – who managed to hold Inter to a 0-0 draw at home earlier in the season by defending deep and limiting space for Mauro Icardi and Ivan Perisic to exploit.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Conte is a world-class manager, but he may need to adapt his style of play if he wants to get Inter back into contention for major trophies.</p>
<h1 id="Antonio-Conte-Admits-Inter-Milan-Lack-of-Poker-Face"><a href="#Antonio-Conte-Admits-Inter-Milan-Lack-of-Poker-Face" class="headerlink" title="Antonio Conte Admits Inter Milan Lack of Poker Face"></a>Antonio Conte Admits Inter Milan Lack of Poker Face</h1><p>The Inter Milan manager has conceded that the lack of a poker face has cost his side in recent matches. Conte believes that the Nerazzurri’s inability to keep their emotions in check has resulted in costly defeats against Juventus and Napoli.</p>
<p>Inter had started the season brightly, but their unbeaten run came to an end when they lost 2-0 to Juventus on November 10th. The following week, they were beaten again by Napoli, this time 3-2.</p>
<p>In an interview with Premium Sport, Conte said: “We must improve our ability not to show our opponents what we are thinking. We have to be able to keep our thoughts hidden and have a poker face. Right now we are too open and Veron and Modric can see what we are doing.”</p>
<p>Conte also believes that the team’s defensive minded approach is costing them at the other end of the pitch. He added: “We are conceding goals too easily and we need to find a balance between defence and attack.”</p>
<p>Inter currently sit in third place in Serie A, six points behind leaders Juventus.</p>
<h1 id="Can-Inter-Milan-Find-a-Poker-Face-Before-Juventus"><a href="#Can-Inter-Milan-Find-a-Poker-Face-Before-Juventus" class="headerlink" title="Can Inter Milan Find a Poker Face Before Juventus?"></a>Can Inter Milan Find a Poker Face Before Juventus?</h1><p>The Derby Della Madonnina–the Milan derby– is one of the most-watched Serie A matches each season. This year’s edition, though, may not have the same appeal.</p>
<p>Both Inter Milan and AC Milan are languishing in the lower half of the table, well below where they would like to be at this point in the season. And with reigning champions Juventus almost certain to win their seventh consecutive Serie A title, these two clubs will be battling it out for second place and an automatic berth in next season’s UEFA Champions League.</p>
<p>AC Milan come into this match on a bit of a roll, having won their last two league games. But they still sit in sixth place, six points behind Inter Milan. Inter, meanwhile, have lost their last two league games, putting them in real danger of dropping below their cross-town rivals by the end of the weekend.</p>
<p>One thing that could give Inter a boost is their new head coach Stefano Pioli. He took over from Frank de Boer in November and has managed to improve their results somewhat. But it will still take a lot of work for Inter to catch up to Juventus.</p>
<p>This derby promises to be a close affair, but Inter may just have the edge due to their home pitch advantage. However, AC Milan should not be counted out and should not be taken lightly–especially after recent wins over Atalanta and Fiorentina.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Will-Win-the-Battle-of-the-Poker-Faces"><a href="#Who-Will-Win-the-Battle-of-the-Poker-Faces" class="headerlink" title="Who Will Win the Battle of the Poker Faces?"></a>Who Will Win the Battle of the Poker Faces?</h1><p>There’s no question that poker faces are serious business.</p>
<p>Just ask any professional poker player. They’ll tell you that having a good poker face is essential to any successful game.</p>
<p>But who has the best poker face in the business?</p>
<p>That’s a tough question to answer, but we’re going to give it a try.</p>
<p>Here are the top 5 contenders for the best poker face in the world of poker:</p>
<ol>
<li>Phil Ivey</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to poker faces, Phil Ivey is in a league of his own. He’s known for his stoic demeanor and unreadable expressions. Ivey is so good at hiding his tells that he’s been nicknamed “the Tiger Woods of Poker”.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Daniel Negreanu</li>
</ol>
<p>Daniel Negreanu may not have the killer instinct of Phil Ivey, but he does have one of the strongest poker faces in the business. Negreanu is able to keep a cool head under pressure and never seems to get rattled, no matter how intense the game gets.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Gus Hansen</li>
</ol>
<p>Gus Hansen is another player known for his impressive poker face. He may not be as smooth as Phil Ivey or Daniel Negreanu, but he definitely has a talent for staying calm and in control during high-stakes games.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Tom Dwan</li>
</ol>
<p>Tom Dwan is another player known for his unflappable attitude at the table. He may not have as much experience as some of the other players on this list, but he makes up for it with his unbelievable coolness under fire.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Antonio Esfandiari Antonio Esfandiari is easily one of the most entertaining players on the professional poker circuit, but don’t let his playful demeanor fool you – he also has one of the strongest poker faces around. Esfandiari doesn’t get rattled easily and always seems to stay in control no matter what cards he’s holding</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Inter-Milan-Hope-to-Find-Their-Poker-Face"><a href="#Inter-Milan-Hope-to-Find-Their-Poker-Face" class="headerlink" title="Inter Milan Hope to Find Their Poker Face"></a>Inter Milan Hope to Find Their Poker Face</h1><p>Just when it looked like Serie A was Luciano Spalletti’s to lose, Inter Milan have hit a snag. The Nerazzurri have now lost two consecutive league games, and their top spot is quickly being taken by Napoli and Juventus. This has sparked plenty of concern among the Inter faithful, who are starting to wonder if the team is really ready to make a run at the Scudetto.</p>
<p>Naturally, the poor form has also given rise to plenty of criticism for Spalletti. The former Roma manager was brought in to steady the ship after Frank de Boer’s disastrous tenure, but it appears that he may not be up to the task. One of the main criticisms levelled against him is his lack of tactical flexibility – he tends to stick with the same formation and tactics regardless of the opponent.</p>
<p>This may work against teams that can be easily outmanoeuvred, but it won’t cut it against more tactically astute sides. In addition, Spalletti’s man-management leaves much to be desired; he has a habit of alienating some of his best players, such as Mauro Icardi and Ivan Perisic.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Inter, they have time to fix these problems before the Champions League resumes in February. In the meantime, they will need to rediscover their poker face if they want to stay ahead of the chasing pack in Serie A.</p>

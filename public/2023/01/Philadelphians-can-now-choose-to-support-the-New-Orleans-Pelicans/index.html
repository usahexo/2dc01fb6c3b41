<p>No, the Phillies, Sixers, and Eagles are not going anywhere (at least not yet), but with the recent acquisition of All-Star forward Anthony Davis by the New Orleans Pelicans, Philly fans now have another team to root for.</p>
<p>For those who are unfamiliar, the Pelicans are a professional basketball team that play in the NBA’s Western Conference. The team is based in New Orleans, Louisiana and was founded in 2002. The Pelicans’ best season came in 2009-10 when they made it all the way to the Conference Finals before losing to the LA Lakers.</p>
<p>The Pelicans’ current roster includes Davis (of course), Jrue Holiday, Rajon Rondo, Nikola Mirotic, and E’Twaun Moore. Not bad at all.</p>
<p>So how do Philadelphia fans go about supporting the Pelicans? First of all, you need to get yourself a Pelican Nation jersey. You can find them on Amazon or on the official Pelican Nation website (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.pelicannationltd.com/">www.pelicannationltd.com</a>).</p>
<p>Next, you need to start following the Pelicans on social media. The best way to do this is to go to the team’s official website (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.nba.com/pelicans">www.nba.com/pelicans</a>) and click on “Follow” in the top right corner of the homepage. From there, you can follow the Pelicans on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to show your support for the team by attending games at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans (or watching them on TV). The Smoothie King Center is where the Pelicans play their home games. You can buy tickets on the team’s website or on StubHub.</p>
<p>So that’s it! If you’re a Philadelphia sports fan and want to switch allegiances to another team, then I recommend supporting the New Orleans Pelicans. Go Pelican Nation!</p>
<h1 id="Philadelphia-welcomes-the-New-Orleans-Pelicans-with-open-arms"><a href="#Philadelphia-welcomes-the-New-Orleans-Pelicans-with-open-arms" class="headerlink" title="Philadelphia welcomes the New Orleans Pelicans with open arms"></a>Philadelphia welcomes the New Orleans Pelicans with open arms</h1><p>The Philadelphia 76ers played host to the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday night and welcomed them with open arms. The Sixers were without their top two players, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, but that did not stop them from putting on a show for the hometown fans.</p>
<p>Dario Saric led the way for the Sixers, scoring a game-high 28 points. He was aided by JJ Redick, who added 22 points of his own. The Pelicans were led by Anthony Davis, who scored 26 points and pulled down 11 rebounds.</p>
<p>The Sixers took control of the game in the second quarter, outscoring the Pelicans 38-21 in the period. They would never look back, as they cruised to a 116-108 victory.</p>
<p>With the win, the Sixers improve to 16-7 on the season. They remain in fifth place in the Eastern Conference, but they have pulled to within one game of the fourth place Pacers.</p>
<p>The Pelicans fall to 16-10 with the loss. They remain in third place in the Western Conference, but they have now lost two straight games after winning six of their previous seven contests.</p>
<p>The Sixers will be back in action on Friday night when they take on the Miami Heat. The Pelicans will also be in action on Friday night when they take on the Washington Wizards.</p>
<h1 id="The-Philadelphia-76ers-have-some-competition-in-the-city"><a href="#The-Philadelphia-76ers-have-some-competition-in-the-city" class="headerlink" title="The Philadelphia 76ers have some competition in the city"></a>The Philadelphia 76ers have some competition in the city</h1><p>The Philadelphia 76ers have been the only professional basketball team in the city for a long time. But that is starting to change. The Philadelphia Fusion, a new Overwatch League team, is making its presence felt in the city.</p>
<p>The Fusion finished their first season in fourth place in the league, behind only the Boston Uprising, Los Angeles Valiant, and London Spitfire. They were one of just two teams to make it to the playoffs from the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>While they were ultimately unsuccessful in their playoff run, losing to the London Spitfire in the semifinals, they put up a good fight. After falling behind 3-1 in the series, they won two games in a row before ultimately losing 4-2.</p>
<p>This was a good showing for a team that is still relatively new. They are sure to improve as they get more experience under their belts.</p>
<p>In addition to their successes on the field, the Philadelphia Fusion have also been very active in the community. They have worked with local schools and youth organizations to help promote sports and healthy lifestyles among young people.</p>
<p>They have also partnered with several local businesses, including Comcast Spectacor and PHL17, to bring fans unique experiences and promote the team’s brand.</p>
<p>With all that they have done in their first season, it is clear that the Philadelphia Fusion are here to stay. The 76ers may soon find themselves with some competition for fan support in the city.</p>
<h1 id="The-New-Orleans-Pelicans-are-coming-to-town-and-they’re-ready-to-play"><a href="#The-New-Orleans-Pelicans-are-coming-to-town-and-they’re-ready-to-play" class="headerlink" title="The New Orleans Pelicans are coming to town and they’re ready to play"></a>The New Orleans Pelicans are coming to town and they’re ready to play</h1><p>The New Orleans Pelicans are coming to town for a matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies on November 7. Led by Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins, the Pelicans are a team to watch in the Western Conference this season.</p>
<p>The Grizzlies will need to play well defensively to stand a chance against the high-powered offense of the Pelicans. Marc Gasol and Mike Conley will need to be at their best if Memphis wants to win this game.</p>
<p>Some other players to watch in this matchup include Jrue Holiday for the Pelicans and Tyreke Evans for the Grizzlies. Both players are capable of scoring in bunches and can take over a game if necessary.</p>
<p>This should be an exciting game to watch, and it should be close throughout. The Grizzlies will need to play well defensively to win, but they certainly have the offensive firepower to pull off an upset.</p>

      States Can Regulate Gambling, but Who Will Benefit

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="States-Can-Regulate-Gambling-but-Who-Will-Benefit"><a href="#States-Can-Regulate-Gambling-but-Who-Will-Benefit" class="headerlink" title="States Can Regulate Gambling, but Who Will Benefit?"></a>States Can Regulate Gambling, but Who Will Benefit?</h1><p>In a landmark decision, the US Supreme Court ruled that individual states have the right to regulate gambling within their borders. This reversed a federal law that had outlawed sports betting in most states. The decision opens the door for a flurry of gambling-related legislation as states seek to tap into what is expected to be a multi-billion dollar industry.</p>
<p>Supporters of the decision argue that it will create jobs and generate much-needed tax revenue for cash-strapped states. They also point out that gambling is already taking place illegally, so it makes sense to regulate it and tax it instead. Detractors argue that gambling addiction can be harmful to individuals and society as a whole. They also claim that gambling businesses are not likely to create many jobs, and that any tax revenue generated will be offset by the costs of treating problem gamblers.</p>
<p>So who stands to benefit from the Supreme Court’s decision? The answer largely depends on the state involved. In Nevada, which has long been associated with gambling, there will likely be new casinos and other businesses related to gambling popping up soon. In New Jersey, which recently legalized sports betting, there may be an increase in tourism as people come to take advantage of the new opportunities.</p>
<p>But in other states, such as Texas, which has strict laws against most forms of gambling, little is likely to change. Gambling is only allowed at tribal casinos, and there are no plans to expand this. So while some states are poised to benefit greatly from the Supreme Court’s ruling, others will see little or no change.</p>
<h1 id="Royal-Panda-Says-States-Can-Regulate-Gambling-Here’s-Why"><a href="#Royal-Panda-Says-States-Can-Regulate-Gambling-Here’s-Why" class="headerlink" title="Royal Panda Says States Can Regulate Gambling, Here’s Why"></a>Royal Panda Says States Can Regulate Gambling, Here’s Why</h1><p>The online gambling industry is a murky and uncertain legal landscape. Regulations on what is and isn’t allowed vary from country to country, state to state, and even town to town. So it’s no surprise that when the international online casino Royal Panda announced that it would be expanding into the United States, there was some confusion about what was allowed and what wasn’t.</p>
<p>Royal Panda has now released a statement asserting that each individual US state has the right to regulate its own gambling industry as it sees fit. The company believes that this will create “a more open and healthy environment for both operators and players.”</p>
<p>The news comes as something of a bombshell in the world of online gambling, as most companies have been waiting for clarification on the legality of online casino operations from the US government before moving in. But with so much variation between states, it seems unlikely that a single overarching set of regulations could be drawn up.</p>
<p>Royal Panda already operates in a number of countries where gambling is legal, including the United Kingdom, Malta, and Sweden. The company has been in operation since 2014 and has built up a reputation for being a reliable and trustworthy operator. It is licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority and the UK Gambling Commission.</p>
<p>It’s not clear yet how Royal Panda’s announcement will play out in terms of regulations in the United States, but it’s likely that other operators will follow suit and begin to explore opportunities in different states. This could lead to a more fragmented online gambling market in the US, with different states having different regulations governing which sites are allowed to operate there.</p>
<h1 id="Utah-Takes-a-Stand-Against-Royal-Panda’s-States-Can-Regulate-Gambling-Claim"><a href="#Utah-Takes-a-Stand-Against-Royal-Panda’s-States-Can-Regulate-Gambling-Claim" class="headerlink" title="Utah Takes a Stand Against Royal Panda’s States Can Regulate Gambling Claim"></a>Utah Takes a Stand Against Royal Panda’s States Can Regulate Gambling Claim</h1><p>On Tuesday, the 8th of January, 2019, the Attorney General of Utah, Sean Reyes, made a statement saying that Utah would be fighting Royal Panda’s claim that individual states cannot regulate gambling. The announcement was made during the National Association of Attorneys General winter meeting in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Royal Panda has been pushing for the repeal of PASPA (The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), which would allow states to regulate gambling within their own borders. They filed a lawsuit in 2018 claiming that the act is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Utah isn’t the only state to take issue with Royal Panda’s claim; 18 other states have joined in on the lawsuit. Reyes said: “We feel confident in our argument and we look forward to making our case before Judge Colin [sic] Lauinger in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p>The main issue that seems to be causing concern among the states is whether or not they will be able to keep track of gambling activity if it is allowed within their borders. Many feel that this could lead to an increase in crime and addiction rates, as well as other negative consequences.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Governor-Backs-Royal-Panda-in-States-Can-Regulate-Gambling-Argument"><a href="#Nevada-Governor-Backs-Royal-Panda-in-States-Can-Regulate-Gambling-Argument" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Governor Backs Royal Panda in States Can Regulate Gambling Argument"></a>Nevada Governor Backs Royal Panda in States Can Regulate Gambling Argument</h1><p>The governor of Nevada has come out in support of the online casino operator Royal Panda in its ongoing legal battle with the US state of Kentucky. Royal Panda is arguing that the US states are allowed to regulate gambling within their own borders, regardless of whether or not that gambling takes place online or offline.</p>
<p>This stance is in line with similar arguments made by other operators in the industry, including PokerStars and Full Tilt. All three companies were forced to shut down their operations in the United States following the enactment of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) in 2006. However, they have all continued to operate in other jurisdictions around the world.</p>
<p>Royal Panda first launched its online casino operation in 2014, and currently offers its services to customers in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The company is currently licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA).</p>
<p>In a statement issued on Wednesday, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval said that he was “proud to stand alongside Royal Panda as it defends against Kentucky’s attempt to extraterritorially regulate internet gaming.” He added that he believes that “the Lyon County District Court made the right decision when it ruled that Kentucky’s law was unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>This ruling came late last year after Kentucky filed a lawsuit against Royal Panda and three other operators – PokerStars, Full Tilt and Absolute Poker – seeking damages totaling more than $600 million. The state claims that these companies violated Kentucky law by accepting bets from residents of the state.</p>
<p>Royal Panda has indicated that it intends to continue fighting the case all the way to the US Supreme Court if necessary.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut-Leads-the-Way-in-Regulating-Gambling-as-Per-Royal-Panda"><a href="#Connecticut-Leads-the-Way-in-Regulating-Gambling-as-Per-Royal-Panda" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut Leads the Way in Regulating Gambling as Per Royal Panda"></a>Connecticut Leads the Way in Regulating Gambling as Per Royal Panda</h1><p>The state of Connecticut has been at the forefront of gambling regulation in the United States. It was one of the first states to legalize commercial casinos, and it has also been among the leaders in regulating online gambling.</p>
<p>In 2012, Connecticut legalized commercial casinos. The state has since seen a surge in gambling revenue, with casinos bringing in over $1.3 billion in 2018. This makes Connecticut one of the most successful casino states in the country.</p>
<p>The state has also taken a strong stance on online gambling. In 2017, Connecticut became one of the first states to pass legislation regulating online gambling. The law requires licensed operators to verify the age and location of players, as well as ensure that gamblers are not addicted to gambling.</p>
<p>The success of Connecticut’s gambling industry is a testament to the need for strong regulation. By implementing strict regulations, Connecticut has been able to protect its citizens while also benefiting from the growth of the industry.</p>

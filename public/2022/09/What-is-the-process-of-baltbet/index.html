The Vikings joined the National Football League (NFL) as an expansion team in 1960, and first took the field for the 1961 season. The team competes in the National Football Conference (NFC) North division.</p>
<p>The franchise was founded in 1959 by Max Winter and Bill Boyer, who named the team after Minnesota’s landscape of 10,000 lakes and the Norse mythology of Ragnarök.

They would not qualify again for playoffs until 1978.</p>
<p>In 1969, the team began playing at Metropolitan Stadium in suburban Bloomington, and played there through 1981. During the 1982 offseason, they moved to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in downtown Minneapolis. The Vikings played their last game at the Metrodome on December 29, 2013, defeating the Detroit Lions 34–14 before collapsing amid a squabble with then-Governor Mark Dayton over public funding for a new stadium; they now play at U.S. Bank Stadium which opened in 2016.</p>
<p>The Vikings have won one NFL championship (Super Bowl IV), four conference championships (1973 NFC Championship Game, 1974 NFC Championship Game, 1976 NFC Championship Game and 2009 NFC Championship Game), and 18 divisional titles (1969 NFC Central Division Champions, 1970 NFC Central Division Champions, 1971 NFC Central Division Champions, 1973 NFC East Division Champions, 1974 NFC East Division Champions, 1975 NFC East Division Champions, 1976 NFC East Division Champions*, 1977 NFC East Division Champions*, 1978 NFC East Division Champions*, 1979 NFC East Division Champions*, 1980 NFC East Division Champions*, 1981 AFC Central Division Champions*, 1998 NFC Central Division Champions*, 2002 NFC North Division Champions*, 2004 NFL Wild Card Weekend winners**,, 2009 AFC North Division Champions*).</p>
